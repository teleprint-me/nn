## **Overview**

The `model.cpp` file is an example of a simple neural network implementation that uses the GGML Tensor Library for matrix multiplication operations on tensors with half-precision floating point data (F16).

### **File Structure**

This section describes the layout and organization of the source code within `model.cpp`.

### **Dependencies**

Here we discuss any dependencies required to build, compile, or execute this example file.

### **Initializing the GGML Context**

Detailed explanation on initializing the GGML context with a predefined memory size and handling potential initialization failures.

### **Creating Tensors with Half Precision Data (F16)**

This section covers how to create 2D tensors of specified dimensions using half-precision floating point data, as demonstrated in this example file.

### **Matrix Multiplication Operations using ggml\_mul() and ggml\_add()**

A detailed explanation on performing matrix multiplication operations using the `ggml_mul` function to compute tensor products and adding tensors together with the help of `ggml_add`.

### **Cleaning Up Resources**

This section discusses how to free resources allocated for the GGML context and the created tensors when finished.

### **Limitations and Future Work**

Here we outline some limitations in this example, such as lack of error handling or support for backward propagation (backward pass), and suggest potential improvements for future development.
