# GGML Model Implementation - `xor.cpp`

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the `xor.cpp` file within the GGML Tensor Library, detailing tensor creation, matrix multiplication operations, and error handling. It builds upon the `model.cpp` example program to guide developers through the code and its functionalities.

For a comprehensive overview on file structure, dependencies, initializing the ggml context, working with tensors, and cleaning up resources, please reference the `model.md` documentation and associated `model.cpp` program instead.

This document will focus on implementing the XOr model instead.

## 1. Overview

For the XOR model, you'll primarily need the following operations, which are typical in basic neural network implementations:

1. **Matrix Multiplication**:
   - **Operation**: Used to compute the weighted sum of inputs in neural network layers.
   - **GGML Equivalent**: `ggml_mul_mat` (for matrix multiplication).

2. **Addition**:
   - **Operation**: Adds bias terms to the weighted sum of inputs.
   - **GGML Equivalent**: `ggml_add`.

3. **Activation Functions**:
   - **Operation**: Applies non-linear transformations to the output of a layer (e.g., Sigmoid or ReLU).
   - **GGML Equivalent**: GGML might have built-in activation functions like `ggml_sigmoid`, `ggml_relu`, or you might need to implement custom ones.

4. **Loss Calculation**:
   - **Operation**: Measures the difference between the model's prediction and the actual output (e.g., Mean Squared Error).
   - **GGML Equivalent**: GGML may not have a specific loss function built-in, so you might need to construct this manually using basic operations like subtraction (`ggml_sub`) and element-wise multiplication (`ggml_mul`).

5. **Backpropagation (Gradient Descent)**:
   - **Operation**: Updates weights and biases based on the calculated gradients from the loss function.
   - **GGML Equivalent**: You will likely need to compute gradients manually using operations like `ggml_mul` for chain rule applications. GGML may have basic support for backward operations, but manual implementation could be necessary.

6. **Initialization of Weights and Biases**:
   - **Operation**: Initialize the parameters (weights and biases) for the model.
   - **GGML Equivalent**: Youâ€™ll likely use `ggml_set_f32` or similar functions to initialize these tensors.

7. **Tensor Creation**:
   - **Operation**: Create tensors for input, weights, biases, and output.
   - **GGML Equivalent**: `ggml_new_tensor_2d` or other appropriate functions for tensor creation.
