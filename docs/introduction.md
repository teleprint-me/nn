# **GGML Overview**

The [GGML](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) Tensor Library is a minimalistic approach for various machine learning tasks such as linear regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks. This library revolves around defining tensor operations using a computation graph to represent the core of its computational model.

## **Key Components**

1. **Minimalistic Approach**: GGML focuses on essential operations for machine learning tasks with a deferred execution mechanism.
2. **Automatic Differentiation and Optimization**: The library includes mechanisms for automatic differentiation, which is critical for training neural networks and other models.
3. **Memory Management**: Careful memory management is crucial as the library requires pre-allocated memory during initialization.

### **Design Philosophy**

#### **Deferred Computation**:
   - Tensor operations are defined in a deferred manner, meaning they're not executed immediately but rather when explicitly requested using `ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx`.

#### **Computation Graph**:
   - The library uses computation graphs to represent the relationships between tensor operations.

### **Memory Management**

#### **Pre-allocated Memory Buffer**:
   - GGML requires careful memory management with a pre-allocated buffer during initialization (`ggml_init`).

#### **Reusable Memory**:
   - The library emphasizes memory efficiency by allowing the reuse of the same memory buffer for multiple computations.

### **Setting Values and Fetching Results**

Before computation, values must be set for input variables and parameters using functions like `ggml_set_f32`. After computation, results can be retrieved with functions such as `ggml_get_f32_1d`.

### **Multi-dimensional Tensors**

#### **Data Types**:
   - GGML primarily supports FP16 and FP32 data types for neural network operations but could theoretically extend to other types.

#### **Tensor Dimensions**:
   - The library supports tensors up to 4 dimensions.
