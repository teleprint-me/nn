/*
 * xor.cpp
 *
 * This file is intended as a test bed for implementing a simple XOR model
 * using the GGML library. The XOR model will demonstrate basic forward and
 * backward computation using GGML's tensor operations and computation graph.
 *
 * Key components to be implemented:
 * - Initialization of tensors for the XOR problem
 * - Definition of the forward pass computation
 * - Implementation of the backward pass for training
 * - Basic error handling and validation
 *
 * Future enhancements:
 * - Integrate advanced features such as custom activation functions
 * - Optimize memory usage and computation efficiency
 * - Explore additional machine learning tasks and models
 *
 * Note: This file is currently a stub and will be developed further as
 * part of the ongoing exploration and application of the GGML library.
